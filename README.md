# Project Description
The purpose of this project was to investigate the diversity in plants and animals in 4 different national parks. The data are in two different data files: observations.csv and species_info.csv. The main code is in the biodiversity.ipynb.

The main findings were that vascular plants were the most common species in all 4 national parks. In addition, out of 4 different conservation_statuses (Species of Concern, Threatened, Endangered, and In Recovery), Species of Concern was the most common with birds being the majority of the category followed by vascular plants and mammals. Thus, it would be wise to keep a main watch on these specific type of species to prevent them from escalating to a more dangerous conservation_status such as endangered.

This project further solidified my data science skills. I made this project after my previous two projects so I learned from my past mistakes and implemented my new knowledge into this project. A future step for me would be to continue doing these data science projects and applying more techniques such as machine learning into them.
